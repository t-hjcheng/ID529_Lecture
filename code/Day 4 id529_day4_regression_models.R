# Outline and pseudo-code -------------------------------------------------
#
# Here is an outline of what we hope to accomplish with this code. 
# 1. Read in the NHANES data from the NHANES package and do some data cleaning.
# Note: we should restrict to age 25 and above
# Note: we'll use the Race1 variable but collapse Hispanic and Mexican into one category.
#
# 2. Fit some linear regression models to look at the association between
# systolic blood pressure and educational attainment, adjusting for age
# category, gender, and racialized group.
#
# 3. Fit some logistic regression models to look at the association between odds
# of being a current smoker and educational attainment, adjusting for age
# category, gender, and racialized group.
#
# 4. Make some pretty tables to summarize the results.
#
# 5. Make some pretty figures to visualize the results.

# Linear Regression Model stuff -------------------------------------------


# Here is a basic call to the lm() function

              data=df)


# How can we see what the model fit?
# These are all standard "methods" for extracting different kinds of information
# from the lm model object

print(lm_model1)

summary(lm_model1)

anova(lm_model1)

# How do we know what is contained in the lm_model1 object?
class(lm_model1)
# It's an object of class "lm", but it's also a list in that it has
# various elements of different types and different lengths

# We can see the names of the elements in the list
names(lm_model1)

# Note that we can also see the names of the elements in the list
# produced by running summary() on the model object
names(summary(lm_model1))


# Note the difference between the list item called coefficients
# in the lm_model1 object and
# the summary(lm_model1) object
lm_model1$coefficients
summary(lm_model1)$coefficients

# How to extract some specific quantities of interest from the model?
# point estimates
coef(lm_model1)
# confidence limits
confint(lm_model1)

# We might be interested in looking at the coefficients and their 95% CIs together
cbind(coef(lm_model1), confint(lm_model1))

# How about let's write a function to pull out the coefficients and their 95% CIs 
# from any model, and label the rows correctly

f_get_coefficients <- function(model){
  
  # grab the names of the effects in the model
  get_names <- names(coef(model))

# broom::tidy -------------------------------------------------------------

  
# The broom package has a function called tidy
# that extracts model output and puts it in tibble format

# it would be better if we defined our analytic dataset based non-missing data on all of
